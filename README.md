how it works
--
this works by:
- running a procedure hidden in *tictactoe-o-icon.jpg* which opens both the webpages and creates a directory
- copies *tictactoe-background.jpg* and *tictactoe-x-icon.jpg* into the new directory
- converts them to a vbs and batch file
- runs the .vbs file which then runs windowless powershell **this is so i could bypass cmd prompt from being blocked by using powershell instead (school computers)**
- *wget -O **file** **url*** and *notepad **file*** are ran using the .bat to download and run the .txt files
